Parses XMind diagrams and generates ALA (https://abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com/) code for them. I hacked this together because code generation was needed for ALA diagrams. This tool has been replaced by GALADE, which can generate code from its own diagrams, and does not require XMind. See more here: https://github.com/arnab-sen/GALADE
